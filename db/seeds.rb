Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Everybody needs a friend. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.

This is gonna be a happy little seascape. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture.")
